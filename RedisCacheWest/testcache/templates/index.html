My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.

About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.

About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.

About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.

About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.

About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.

About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

My Art
Once upon a time I wanted to be an artist. Ah well, coding is art, right? right??

Here are a few from good old days.
About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani . My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), Active Learning for NLP, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj.
